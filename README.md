# CPP-LinkedList

Linked List:
The goal is to make a linked list of x elements.
linked list is made using a node from struct. We then added three pointers head, tail, and a temp. 
temp will point to the new node that has the data and pointed to NULL. 
We set head to NULL and looped the adding of the node in a for loop of 100. 
We the proceeded to make the head node by if head == NULL then we point head and tail to the first node.
If the head is not NULL meaning that it exists, we connect the most recent node to the new node by connecting the tail to the tmp then moving the tail pointer to the tmp. 
This will be looped x times to create x elements of linked list.
